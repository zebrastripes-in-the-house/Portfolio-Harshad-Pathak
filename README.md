# Harshad Pathak - Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This project showcases my work as a Designer and Developer through an interactive, responsive Bento Grid layout.

## About Me

I specialize in UI/UX, Graphic and Brand Design, with growing interest in Full-Stack Development. Based in Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India. I am a Sophomore pursuing B.tech (Computer Science Engineering) at IIIT Vadodara (Gandhinagar Campus).

I focus on clean visuals, cohesive systems, and interfaces built on clarity. My process is driven by a clear structure and a steady attention to how people think and move through an experience.
